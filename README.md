**Build enterprise applications using microservices, DevOps, EF Core, and design patterns for Azure**

The authors of this book are -[Gabriel Baptista]() and [Francesco Abbruzzese]()
## About the book

Software Architecture with C# 12 and .NET 8 puts high-level design theory to work in a .NET context, teaching you the key skills, technologies, and best practices required to become an effective .NET software architect.
This fourth edition puts emphasis on a case study that will bring your skills to life. You’ll learn how to choose between different architectures and technologies at each level of the stack. You’ll take an even closer look at Blazor and explore OpenTelemetry for observability, as well as a more practical dive into preparing .NET microservices for Kubernetes integration.
Divided into three parts, this book starts with the fundamentals of software architecture, covering C# best practices, software domains, design patterns, DevOps principles for CI/CD, and more. The second part focuses on the technologies, from choosing data storage in the cloud to implementing frontend microservices and working with Serverless. You’ll learn about the main communication technologies used in microservices, such as REST API, gRPC, Azure Service Bus, and RabbitMQ. The final part takes you through a real-world case study where you’ll create software architecture for a travel agency.
By the end of this book, you will be able to transform user requirements into technical needs and deliver highly scalable enterprise software architectures.
